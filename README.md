A twitter bot (@trollypants) for troll Ramsey Nasser (@ra)
It is written in python, it need installing the following packages first:
- tweepy
- nltk
You can change the person you haunt him by changing the twitter username in all the code

The logic is simple: 
- Get random tweet from Ramesy
- Get random word from the tweet
- Put that word in Google Search and get one of the autocomplete suggestions (Google Milking Thanks to Mike Cook (@mtrc) for the idea)
- Reply to the tweet using the result from the previous sentence
- Repeat every time period (from 30mins to 1hour)

There is a bug where it replies on a tweet in code but on twitter its not connected to the tweet as a response (I don't know the reason for that)

This bot is just made for fun No harm was intended :)
